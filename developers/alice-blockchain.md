## Experience Statement

I have 10 years of web2 programming experience, primarily backend work using Java, C++, Rust and relational databases. Since then, I have been working with web3 technologies for 2 years on Ethereum and Polygon, using Truffle and Hardhat.

I have been developing on Sui for the last 6 months and have deployed two projects to mainnet - an experimental NFT marketplace and a swap aggregator.

I am comfortable writing Move and with a broad range of Sui development tools. I have also spent a lot of time with PTBs when building the swap aggregator.
